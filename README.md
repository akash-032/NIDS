# NIDS
A NIDS is designed to monitor network traffic, analyze patterns, and detect potential intrusions or malicious activities in real time. Unlike traditional security measures that focus solely on perimeter defence, such as firewalls, NIDS provides deep visibility into network activities and identifies threats that may have bypassed other security layers. It acts as a vigilant observer, continuously scanning for anomalies or signatures associated with known attack patterns.
There are various approaches to intrusion detection. Signature-based detection relies on predefined patterns of known threats, making it effective against established attacks but less capable of identifying novel ones. Conversely, anomaly-based detection identifies deviations from normal behaviour, offering the ability to detect unknown threats but with a higher likelihood of false positives. Hybrid models combine these methods to balance accuracy and adaptability.
The increasing complexity of networks and the rapid evolution of attack vectors pose significant challenges to the effectiveness of NIDS. Emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics are being integrated into NIDS to enhance their capabilities. These advancements enable the systems to analyze vast amounts of data, identify subtle attack signatures, and adapt to new threats dynamically.
This introduction sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of NIDS, their architecture, methodologies, challenges, and the role they play in fortifying network security in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.
As the reliance on digital networks grows, so does the sophistication and frequency of cyber threats. Organizations face an array of risks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, malware propagation, and denial-of-service attacks, all of which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical resources. To mitigate these threats, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have emerged as a crucial component of modern cybersecurity infrastructure
